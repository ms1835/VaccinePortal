# VaccinePortal

## Description
A mini project to keep track of vaccine requirements in India. This project keeps record of vaccine needed in different states and union territory based on the registrations done on the portal. \
This is an effort which can help authorities to distribute the limited stocks of vaccines to states.

**NOTE: This project was made before the vaccination drive started in India(it might feel absurd now)**
